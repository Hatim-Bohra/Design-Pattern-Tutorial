Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          For example, think about creating a <code>House</code> object. To build a simple house, you need to construct four walls, a floor, and a roof. But what if you want a bigger house with a pool and fancy statues? You'd end up with a constructor like <code>new House(true, true, false, true, 4, \"swimming pool\", \"gold\")</code>.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </PatternSection>\r\n\r\n      <PatternSection title=\"The Solution\">\r\n        <p>\r\n          The <strong>Builder pattern</strong> suggests that you extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separate objects called <em>builders</em>.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The pattern organizes object construction into a set of steps (<code>buildWalls</code>, <code>buildDoor</code>, etc.). To create an object, you execute a series of these steps on a builder object.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </PatternSection>\r\n\r\n      <PatternSection title=\"Interactive Playground\">\r\n        <BuilderDemo />\r\n      </PatternSection>\r\n\r\n      <PatternSection title=\"Implementation Details\">\r\n        <CodeTabs\r\n          tabs={[\r\n            {\r\n              id: \"ts\",\r\n              label: \"QueryBuilder.ts\",\r\n              language: \"typescript\",\r\n              code: `class QueryBuilder {\r\n  private query: Partial<Query> = {};\r\n\r\n  select(fields: string): this {\r\n    this.query.select = fields;\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  from(table: string): this {\r\n    this.query.table = table;\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  where(condition: string): this {\r\n    this.query.where = condition;\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  build(): string {\r\n    return \\`SELECT \\${this.query.select} FROM \\${this.query.table} WHERE \\${this.query.where}\\`;\r\n  }\r\n}`\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              id: \"usage\",\r\n              label: \"usage.ts\",\r\n              language: \"typescript\",\r\n              code: `const query = new QueryBuilder()\r\n  .select(\"id, name\")\r\n  .from(\"users\")\r\n  .where(\"active = true\")\r\n  .build();\r\n\r\nconsole.log(query);`\r\n            }\r\n          ]}\r\n        />\r\n      </PatternSection>\r\n\r\n      {content && (\r\n        <PatternSection title=\"Pros & Cons\">\r\n          <ProsConsList pros={content.pros} cons={content.cons} />\r\n        </PatternSection>\r\n      )}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n","usedDeprecatedRules":[]},{"filePath":"D:\\Design Pattern Tutorial\\design-pattern-tutorial\\src\\app\\patterns\\chain-of-responsibility\\page.tsx","messages":[{"ruleId":"react/no-unescaped-entities","severity":2,"message":"`'` can be escaped with `&apos;`, `&lsquo;`, `&#39;`, `&rsquo;`.","line":33,"column":214,"nodeType":"JSXText","messageId":"unescapedEntityAlts","suggestions":[{"messageId":"replaceWithAlt","data":{"alt":"&apos;"},"fix":{"range":[1633,2004],"text":"\r\n                    After a while, you realized that these checks must be performed sequentially.
